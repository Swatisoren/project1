                            animals, and microorganisms, as well as non-living elements like rocks, water, air, and
                            weather.
                            It includes everything that exists independently of human intervention, creating a complex
                            and

                        <p>Biodiversity and ecosystems are essential for the health of our planet. The variety of life
                            forms
                            contributes to ecosystem stability and resilience, supporting vital processes like nutrient
                            cycling and pollination. Healthy ecosystems provide essential resources and services, such
                            as
                            clean air and water. Protecting this diversity is crucial for maintaining balance and

                            and ecosystems. Key
                            processes like the water cycle, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling sustain life and
                            maintain
                            ecological balance. Physical geography includes landforms such as mountains, valleys, and
                            rivers,
                            influencing climate and habitat distribution. Together, these elements determine how
